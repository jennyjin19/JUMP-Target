# JUMP-Target
A list of compounds with diverse targets that fit on a single 384-well plate. Apart from the 14 `poscons_diverse` 
compounds with are in duplicate, all other compounds are in singlicate. The recommended concentration for these 
compounds is `5 uM`.

There are three types of positive controls in this list
- `poscon_orf`: compounds and genes that correlate strongly in previous CellPainting experiments.
- `poscon_cp`: compounds with a strong association with the genes that they target, according to [ChemicalProbes.org](https://www.chemicalprobes.org/)
- `poscon_diverse`: pairs of compounds with diverse profiles
